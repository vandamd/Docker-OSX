Also special thanks to [@thenickdude](https://github.com/thenickdude) who maintains the valuable fork [KVM-OpenCore](https://github.com/thenickdude/KVM-Opencore), which was started by [@Leoyzen](https://github.com/Leoyzen/)!

Extra special thanks to the OpenCore team over at: https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg. Their well-maintained bootloader provides much of the great functionality that Docker-OSX users enjoy :)
